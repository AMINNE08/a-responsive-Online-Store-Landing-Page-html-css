## Design Choices

### HTML Structure
- **Header**: The header includes a navigation menu with links to different sections of the page. This helps users easily navigate the website.
- **Hero Section**: The hero section features two background images with overlay buttons for "Shop Mens" and "Shop Womens". This design visually divides the page and makes navigation intuitive.
- **Product Section**: The product section features cards for each product. Each card includes an image, product name, brief description, and a "Shop Now" button. This layout presents the products in a clean and organized manner.
- **Review Section**: A section highlighting the high number of five-star reviews to build credibility.
- **Footer**: The footer contains basic information and social media icons, providing a consistent look and feel across the website.

### CSS Styling
- **Typography**: The `Playfair Display` font was chosen for its elegant and modern appearance. It enhances readability and maintains a professional look.
- **Colors**: A vibrant color palette with gradients from dark blue to red was used to create a visually engaging experience. The use of a dark background for the header and footer creates contrast, making the content stand out.
- **Layout**: Flexbox was used extensively to create a flexible and responsive layout that adjusts based on the screen size.
- **Buttons**: The buttons are styled with a dark background and white text, making them prominent and easy to find. The hover effects add interactivity and visual feedback.

### Responsive Design
- **Media Queries**: Media queries are used to adjust the layout for different screen sizes. For example, product cards are displayed in a single column on smaller screens to ensure readability and usability.
- **Flexbox**: Flexbox was utilized to create a flexible and responsive layout for the product section, allowing it to adjust and align items based on the screen size.

### Animations and Enhancements
- **Animations**: CSS animations (e.g., `animate__pulse`) are used to add subtle movements to the product images, enhancing the user experience.
- **Boxicons**: Boxicons are used for social media icons in the footer, ensuring a cohesive and modern look.
